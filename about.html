            <h2>How did I get started with coding?</h2>
            <p class="firstPar">
                I graduated with a Masters Degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in May 2020. Although this was a
                great accomplishment, I did not feel fulfilled with my Master's degree. Suddenly, I asked myself if I
                wanted to do this for the rest of my life. I did not feel comfortable with the answer, or I did not know
                how to answer it.
            </p>

                For a while, I felt stuck because I didn't feel like I had many options. I did not want to go back to
                school and do another four-plus year in school and add to my school debt. For a month or so, I was like
                a zombie, waking up and spend the whole day wondering what am I going to do. There has to be another
                way. Every day, I would wake up and dread about my step. At some point, I had to decide if I would
                continue to pursue a career in Mental Health or be stuck doing nothing. These were my options, at least
                to me at the time, and doing nothing was not an option. So, in reality, it was pursuing a career in the
                Mental Health field and be unhappy, and that is it.

                So how did I find coding or how coding found me. As everyone who is lost and have nothing to do, we go
                and get even more lost on YouTube. Continuously clicking and clicking on videos and barely paying
                attention, I landed on a YouTuber programming on Python. At the time, I didn't know what Python was, but
                I remember suddenly sitting up and being amazed at what she was doing. She created a program that would
                make a playlist on her Spotify based on her saved playlist on her YouTube. Watching that felt amazing to
                me, and I remember saying aloud that I want to learn how to do that. From that moment, I went to look
                online for courses and never looked back.
